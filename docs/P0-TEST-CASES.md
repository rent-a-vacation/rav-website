# P0 Test Cases — Critical Path Library

> These are the 24 scenarios that, if broken, mean the platform cannot operate.
> Run with: `npm run test:p0`

## How it works

Tests tagged with `// @p0` in their describe block are included in the P0 suite.
The `test:p0` npm script uses Vitest's `--testNamePattern` to run only P0-tagged tests.

## P0 Test Cases by Journey

### 1. Authentication & Session (4 cases)

| P0-SRCH-02 | Listings can be sorted (price, date, rating) | `src/lib/listingSort.test.ts` | `@p0 sort listings` |
| P0-SRCH-03 | Search results display correct pricing | `src/lib/pricing.test.ts` | `@p0 listing pricing` |

### 3. Pricing & Fees (3 cases)

|----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| P0-PRICE-01 | Night count calculation is correct | `src/lib/pricing.test.ts` | `@p0 calculate nights` |

| P0-PRICE-03 | Cancellation refund calculation by policy | `src/lib/cancellation.test.ts` | `@p0 cancellation refund` |

### 4. Bidding & Booking (3 cases)

| ID | Scenario | Test File | Test Name |
|----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| P0-BID-01 | Renter can create a bid on a listing | `src/hooks/useBidding.test.ts` | `@p0 create bid` |
| P0-BID-02 | Owner can accept/reject a bid | `src/hooks/useBidding.test.ts` | `@p0 update bid status` |
| P0-BID-03 | BidFormDialog submits correct data | `src/components/bidding/BidFormDialog.test.tsx` | `@p0 bid form submit` |

### 5. Owner Operations (3 cases)

| ID | Scenario | Test File | Test Name |

### 6. Cancellation & Disputes (2 cases)

| ID | Scenario | Test File | Test Name |
|----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| P0-CXL-01 | Renter cancellation applies correct policy refund | `src/hooks/useCancelBooking.test.ts` | `@p0 renter cancellation` |
| P0-CXL-02 | Dispute submission creates record | `src/hooks/useSubmitDispute.test.ts` | `@p0 submit dispute` |

### 7. Messaging & Notifications (2 cases)

| ID | Scenario | Test File | Test Name |
|----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| P0-MSG-01 | Booking messages can be sent and received | `src/hooks/useBookingMessages.test.ts` | `@p0 send message` |
| P0-MSG-02 | Realtime subscriptions connect and receive updates | `src/hooks/useRealtimeSubscription.test.ts` | `@p0 realtime subscription` |

### 8. Membership & Subscriptions (4 cases)

| ID | Scenario | Test File | Test Name |
|----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| P0-SUB-01 | Listing limit blocks creation at tier max | `src/hooks/useCheckListingLimit.test.ts` | `@p0 listing limit enforcement` |
| P0-SUB-02 | Subscription checkout completes successfully | `src/hooks/useSubscription.test.ts` | `@p0 subscription checkout` |
| P0-SUB-03 | Commission discount applied correctly per tier | `src/lib/pricing.test.ts` | `@p0 tier commission discount` |
| P0-SUB-04 | Admin override changes tier immediately | `src/hooks/admin/useAdminMemberships.test.ts` | `@p0 admin tier override` |

**P0-SUB-01:** Owner on Free tier with 3 active listings cannot create a 4th. Enforcement at UI level (`useCheckListingLimit`) and DB level (trigger).

**P0-SUB-02:** Owner selects Pro tier → Stripe Checkout → webhook fires → membership updates to Pro. Critical: revenue path.

**P0-SUB-03:** Commission discount applied correctly per tier — Free: 15%, Pro: 13%, Business: 10%. Verified in checkout edge function (`create-booking-checkout`).

**P0-SUB-04:** Admin sets `admin_override=true` → tier changes → webhook respects override.

## Coverage Gaps (Not Yet P0-Tagged)

These critical paths have **no existing tests** — they need new tests before launch:

| Gap | Description | Priority |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| **Checkout/Payment** | Stripe session creation → payment → booking confirmation | CRITICAL |
| **Admin Approval** | Listing approval → email → status change | HIGH |
| **Payout Flow** | Escrow release → Stripe Transfer → owner payout | HIGH |

These are tracked in GitHub Issues and will be addressed in dedicated testing sessions.

## Pre-Release Sign-Off Procedure

Before each production deploy:

1. Run `npm run test:p0` — all 24 P0 tests must pass
2. Run `npm run build` — zero TypeScript errors
3. Run `npm run lint` — zero lint errors
4. Verify on Vercel preview deploy (manual smoke test)
5. Merge PR to `main` with CI passing

---

## Adding New P0 Tests

When adding a new critical path test:

1. Add `@p0` to the test's `describe` or `it` name
2. Add the test to the table above with its P0 ID
3. Verify it runs with `npm run test:p0`

```

## 🎯 ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Add New Files (5 min)

**Copy from outputs folder to your project:**

```bash
cd C:\Repos\personal_gsujit\github_jisujit_tektekgo\rentavacation (GitHub: rent-a-vacation/rav-website)\docs

# Add the hub
copy [downloads]\PROJECT-HUB.md .

# Add chat template
copy [downloads]\NEW-CHAT-TEMPLATE.md guides\
```

---

### Step 2: Merge WHATS-NEXT.md into PROJECT-HUB.md (10 min)

**What to do:**

1. **Open both files side-by-side**
   - `docs/WHATS-NEXT.md` (current)
   - `docs/PROJECT-HUB.md` (new)

2. **Copy any unique content from WHATS-NEXT.md:**
   - Voice issues → Already in PROJECT-HUB.md ✅
   - Phase completion → Already in PROJECT-HUB.md ✅
   - Next steps → Already in PROJECT-HUB.md ✅

3. **Delete WHATS-NEXT.md:**
   ```bash
   del docs\WHATS-NEXT.md
   ```

4. **Update PROJECT-HUB.md:**
   - Change "Last Updated" to today
   - Verify all info is current
   - Add any project-specific details

---

### Step 3: Rename Files for Consistency (2 min)

**Optional but recommended:**

```bash
cd docs\guides

# Rename for consistency
ren COMPLETE-USER-JOURNEY-MAP.md user-journey-map.md

# Create help subfolder
mkdir help
move HOW-TO-SEARCH-WITH-VOICE.md help\voice-search.md
```

**Why:** Shorter names, clearer organization

---

### Step 4: Update Cross-References (5 min)

**Files that may reference old names:**

1. **docs/PROJECT-HUB.md:**
   - Check links to guides
   - Update if you renamed files

2. **docs/features/voice-search/README.md:**
   - Update link if HOW-TO-SEARCH-WITH-VOICE.md was renamed

3. **docs/features/resort-master-data/README.md:**
   - Update link if user-journey-map.md was renamed

**Find & replace:**
```
COMPLETE-USER-JOURNEY-MAP.md → user-journey-map.md
HOW-TO-SEARCH-WITH-VOICE.md → help/voice-search.md
WHATS-NEXT.md → PROJECT-HUB.md
```

---

### Step 5: Create NEW-CHAT-TEMPLATE.md (10 min)

**File:** `docs/guides/NEW-CHAT-TEMPLATE.md`

```markdown
# Starting a New Chat - Rent-A-Vacation

**Copy-paste this into ANY new Claude chat:**

---

Hi Claude! Continuing Rent-A-Vacation project.

**Context Files (please read):**
1. docs/PROJECT-HUB.md - Current status & priorities
2. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Technical architecture
3. [Specific feature docs if working on a feature]

**Project Location:** C:\Repos\personal_gsujit\github_jisujit_tektekgo\rentavacation (GitHub: rent-a-vacation/rav-website)

**Current Phase:** [Copy from PROJECT-HUB.md "Current Status"]

**Today's Goal:** [What I want to accomplish this session]

**Environment:**
- Production: https://rent-a-vacation.com

- Supabase DEV: oukbxqnlxnkainnligfz

Ready to start!

---

**Then Claude will:**
1. Read PROJECT-HUB.md
2. Understand current context
3. Start working on your goal
```

---

### Step 6: Test the System (5 min)

**Simulate starting a new chat:**

1. Open `docs/PROJECT-HUB.md`
2. Read "Current Status" section
3. Check "Top 3 Priorities"
4. Open `docs/guides/NEW-CHAT-TEMPLATE.md`
5. Copy the template
6. Verify all links/paths are correct

**Does it make sense?** ✅ You're ready!

---

### Step 7: Commit Everything (5 min)

```bash
cd C:\Repos\personal_gsujit\github_jisujit_tektekgo\rentavacation (GitHub: rent-a-vacation/rav-website)

# Stage all doc changes
git add docs/

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "docs: Consolidate documentation into unified system

- Add PROJECT-HUB.md (single source of truth)
- Add NEW-CHAT-TEMPLATE.md (for fresh chats)
- Remove WHATS-NEXT.md (merged into PROJECT-HUB)

# Push
git push
```

## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**After transition, verify:**
